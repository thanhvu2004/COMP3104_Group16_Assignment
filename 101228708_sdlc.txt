DevOps plays a crucial role in modern software development by enhancing collaboration 
between development and operations teams. It helps to streamline the software development 
lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring continuous integration, continuous deployment, and automation. 
Adopting DevOps practices leads to faster delivery of high-quality software, reduced deployment 
failures, and improved scalability and reliability of applications. In the SDLC, DevOps 
ensures a faster feedback loop, allowing teams to quickly adapt to changing requirements 
and deliver value to customers more efficiently.
